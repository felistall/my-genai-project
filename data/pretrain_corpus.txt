Artificial intelligence is transforming the world. 
Large language models can learn patterns from a lot of text.
This is a small custom corpus made by Ananya to pretrain a tiny GPT-2 model.
You can add random paragraphs, notes, stories, or any text here.
The more text you add, the better the tiny model can learn patterns.
